# pokedex-php
The challenge of this exercise is to convert the javascript version of the pokedex into PHP

## First PHP experience
For me, there were a lot of factors that made this exercise challenging.
In the beginning I didn't know were to start. I was so used to the DOM that Javascript uses, and I didn't know how to connect php code to the HTML.


After finding a way to do this, things went pretty smooth, and I could convert a lot of my code to PHP.
Until I arrived at the previous and next button. There I became really confused again. It took a long time before I realized which direction I had to go.


I was relieved to find a solution, at the same time I'm not happy with the solution I decided to use. For now though, I'll leave it like this.
